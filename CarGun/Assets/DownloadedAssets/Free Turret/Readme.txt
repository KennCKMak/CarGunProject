Thank you for downloading my Free Turret Example!
I hope you find them useful.

For an easier reference of each piece please find a basic render in the folder PNG.
You will also find the FBX and OBJ folders with the individual exported pieces.
I also included the original .mb files with the full geometry.

If you liked it, please consider checking out the full package at https://gumroad.com/edgeloopxyz

As long as you don't resell them, you can do whatever you want with them.
